# The Future of this extension

In the future, we will add comments, release notes, npm watch mode for easier developement, updated readme to actually focus on extension use rather than building from source details.

Major and urgent:

[]-This post request /markdown give HTML of sent markdown with images attached
[]- show commit message in timeline not just 'added 1 commit'
[]- Implement better ref label: 'Sakun referenced a pull request that will close this issue 2 days ago
WIP: Feat Account Module #374' instead of 'Sakun comment ref 2 days ago' and make the ref label clickable to open the pull request in a new tab.
[]- Implement add comment feature in the details webview for better.

Major and Future:

[]- Update the README file to focus on how to use the extension rather than how to build it from source.
[]- Implement npm watch mode for easier development and testing of the extension.
[]- Add release notes to document changes and updates in each version of the extension.
[]- Consider adding more features based on user feedback and requirements.
